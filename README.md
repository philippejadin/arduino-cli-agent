# arduino-cli-agent
A simple server to allow local compilation and upload of sketches, using arduino-cli called from python

# Usage
Run python3 start.py

A window opens with the logs (debug messages)

A server is created, it responds to localhost:3280

Visit http://localhost:3280/ with a browser.

This is a proof of concept and a work in progress at that :-)
